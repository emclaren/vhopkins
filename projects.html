											<h3> Interest Groups and Democratic Responsiveness</h3>
											<p>Voters are increasingly concerned that special interests control the policy process. Yet the academic literature is more optimistic: Elected officials face strong incentives to listen to voters, not just lobby groups, and this makes for more responsive policies. This project uses a new dataset of Canadian lobbying registrations – spanning 15 policy areas from 1990-2009 – to test how interest group lobbying moderates the relationship between public opinion and government spending. We show empirically that lobbying from “cause” groups – representing diffuse interests like climate change – strengthens responsiveness, while lobbying from “sectional” groups – representing industry and professional associations – has no observable effect. <br>With Heike Klüver and Mark Pickup.

												<h3>Institutions, Incentives & Policy Entrepreneurs</h3>
												<p>Policy entrepreneurship is often used to explain agenda setting through reference to the behavior of individual “change agents.” But there are still gaps in our understanding of what motivates entrepreneurs. Using data from Canada's Public Service Employee Survey, I present evidence that government agencies can incentivize innovation. Departments with many incentives are more likely to encourage innovation among their employees than agencies with few incentives.

												<h3>Interest Groups and Government Accountability</h3>
												<p>In theory, legislators rely on information from interest groups to keep government accountable. But in systems with single party agenda control, there is a strong incentive for groups to communicate with powerful agenda-setters rather than rank-and-file legislators. As agenda control diffuses, access to information grows more equal. To test this claim, I collect a novel dataset of 41,500 lobbying communications from Canada between 2010-2017. Using actor-oriented dynamic network models, I show political parties influence accountability by structuring the flow of information from interest groups to elected officials.

												<h3>Learning From Simulations: How Do We Know What We Know?</h3>
												<p>	Monte Carlo simulations are commonly used to test the performance of estimators across different data generating processes. It is common to report the bias and/or the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the estimator for the parameters of interest. It is far less common to report the percentile range, coverage or power. Each of these five statistics – bias, RMSE, percentile range, coverage and power – provide overlapping but different information regarding the estimator performance. We take three instances in which simulations have been used to produce what is now considered common knowledge and show that that knowledge is incomplete in important ways because coverage and power were not considered.
